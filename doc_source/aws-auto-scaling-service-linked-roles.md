# Service\-Linked Roles for AWS Auto Scaling<a name="aws-auto-scaling-service-linked-roles"></a>

AWS Auto Scaling uses service\-linked roles for the permissions that it requires to call other AWS services on your behalf\. A service\-linked role is a unique type of AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role that is linked directly to an AWS service\. 

Service\-linked roles provide a secure way to delegate permissions to AWS services because only the linked service can assume a service\-linked role\. For more information, see [Using Service\-Linked Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**Note**  
For information about the service\-linked roles created by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Application Auto Scaling, see [Service\-Linked Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-service-linked-role.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* and [Service\-Linked Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Application Auto Scaling User Guide*\.

## Service\-Linked Role Permissions for AWS Auto Scaling<a name="service-linked-role-permissions"></a>

AWS Auto Scaling uses the following service\-linked role to manage predictive scaling of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups on your behalf\. 

The `AWSServiceRoleForAutoScalingPlans_EC2AutoScaling` role is predefined with permissions to make the following calls on your behalf: 
+ `cloudwatch:GetMetricData`
+ `autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups`
+ `autoscaling:DescribeScheduledActions`
+ `autoscaling:BatchPutScheduledUpdateGroupAction`
+ `autoscaling:BatchDeleteScheduledAction`

This role trusts the `autoscaling.amazonaws.com` service to assume it\. 

You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity \(such as a user, group, or role\) to create, edit, or delete a service\-linked role\. For more information, see [Using Service\-Linked Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

## Create Service\-Linked Roles \(Automatic\)<a name="create-service-linked-role-automatic"></a>

AWS Auto Scaling creates the `AWSServiceRoleForAutoScalingPlans_EC2AutoScaling` role for you the first time that you create a scaling plan with predictive scaling enabled\.

**Important**  
Make sure that you have enabled the IAM permissions that allow an IAM entity \(such as a user, group, or role\) to create the service\-linked role\. Otherwise, the automatic creation fails\. For more information, see [Service\-Linked Role Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions) in the *IAM User Guide* or the information about [required user permissions](auth-and-access-control.md) in this guide\.

## Edit the Service\-Linked Roles<a name="edit-service-linked-role"></a>

With the `AWSServiceRoleForAutoScalingPlans_EC2AutoScaling` role created by AWS Auto Scaling, you can edit only its description and not its permissions\. For more information, see [Editing a Service\-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#edit-service-linked-role) in the `IAM User Guide`\.

## Delete the Service\-Linked Roles<a name="delete-service-linked-role"></a>

If you no longer use AWS Auto Scaling, we recommend that you delete the service\-linked role\. You can delete a service\-linked role only after first deleting the related AWS resources\. If a service\-linked role is used with multiple scaling plans, you must delete all scaling plans with predictive scaling enabled before you can delete the role\. This protects your scaling plans because you cannot inadvertently remove permissions to manage them\. For more information, see [Delete Your Scaling Plan](gs-delete-scaling-plan.md)\.

You can use IAM to delete the service\-linked role\. For more information, see [Deleting a Service\-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

After you delete the `AWSServiceRoleForAutoScalingPlans_EC2AutoScaling` service\-linked role, AWS Auto Scaling creates the role again when you create a scaling plan with predictive scaling enabled\. 

## Supported Regions for AWS Auto Scaling Service\-Linked Roles<a name="slr-regions"></a>

AWS Auto Scaling supports using service\-linked roles in all of the regions where the service is available\. For more information, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)\.
